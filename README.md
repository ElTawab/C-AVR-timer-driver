# C-AVR-timer-driver
A C driver that handles Timers in AVR kit in it's three modes.
Three modes:
1-CTC 
2-PWM mode
3-non-inverted PWM mode
The respo also contains a simple program that tests the driver.
The driver also contains driver for Interrupts and ISR as it's used for dealing with timer.
The timer is widely used in a more advanced project in my respos with name smart room link:https://github.com/ElTawab/Smart-room-C-project-AVR.
